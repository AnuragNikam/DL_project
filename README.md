Road Accident Severity Prediction – Deep Learning & Streamlit
Predict the severity of road accidents using Deep Learning with an interactive Streamlit application.
This project processes accident datasets, trains a neural network, visualizes model performance, and allows users to make real-time predictions from a web interface.
Project Overview

This project builds a multi-class classification model that predicts the Accident Severity (e.g., Slight, Serious, Fatal) based on various road accident factors.

The system includes:

✔ Deep Learning model using TensorFlow & Keras
✔ Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling, missing values, feature engineering)
✔ Model evaluation (accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix)
✔ Interactive Streamlit UI
✔ Ability to upload your own CSV dataset
✔ Option to save trained model (.h5)
✔ Visualization of training curves & class distribution
✔ Feature preview & sample prediction
